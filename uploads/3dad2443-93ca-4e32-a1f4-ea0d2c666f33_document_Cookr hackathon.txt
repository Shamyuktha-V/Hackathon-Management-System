problem statement 2

input:

	riders count = n [name list] 

	csv:
		customers	kitchens[names]		customer_location(coorinates)	kitchen_location(coordinates)	order_time	ready_time	
 
Process:

kd tree for customers
kd tree for kitchens

for 1km distance --- calculate the distance using coordinates

for on the way ---- check whether both lies on same side of the root and there is a path between them

for 10 mins - subtract the ready time of the products

for rider reaching time ---- for 1 km 10 mins ( intrepreted from question )


Progress:

rule 1 --- completed  ( same kitchen, same customer, 10 mins )

rule 2 --- completed  ( different kitchen - 1km, same customer, 10 mins )

rule 3 --- completed  ( same kitchen, different customer - 1km, 10 mins )

rule 4 --- rule 2

rule 5 --- rule 2

rule 6 --- completed  ( different kitchen - 2nd kitchen on the way to customer, same customer, ready at the time the rider reaches second customer or 10 mins)

rule 7 --- completed  ( different kitchen - 2nd kitchen on the way to customer, 2nd customer drop on the way to the 1st customer, ready at the time the rider reaches second customer or 10 mins)


rule 8 --- completed  ( same kitchen, 2nd customer drop on the way to the 1st customer, 10 mins)
